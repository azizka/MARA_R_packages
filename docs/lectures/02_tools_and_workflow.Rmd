## RStudio

Has revolutionised the way to interact with R

This Integrated development environment (IDE) is built around some of the most useful R functions/packages (inlc. `devtools` and `roxygen2`).

Lets you set up projects, is integrated with git and makes setting up websites and writing articles/books a breeze!


<br>

<span class="grayed">Shall we take a look at RStudio together or does everybody know their way around?</span>


## Tools

You can do most things by typing commands into the console.

However, if that is too nerdy for you, you can also click on buttons! (<span class="grayed">show some cool buttons</span>)

<br>

Why should you then use the console at all? <br>
-> it makes your work reproducible and more transparent for readers/users of your work.

Here we show mostly how to use the console for making your package.



## `devtools`

tools for building, documenting and testing packages

[link](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools)


## `usethis`

provides many functions that help setting up a package

provides a "standard way of doing things" that ensures you miss no (crucial) step

[link](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/usethis/)


## `testthat`

specify what you expect your functions to do

write unit-tests (test for similar sets of tasks) that validate your expectations

display test progress visually

[link](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/testthat/)


## `roxygen`

generate R documentation

manage the package namespace

[link](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/)


## `checkmate`

make sure that arguments are what they should be

test whether and assert that certain conditions about objects are true

extend the capabilities of `testthat`

[link](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/checkmate/)


## 1. Getting started

You can either click on <br>*File > New Project > New Directory > R package*<br> and provide all sort of information, or simply type in `create_package()` into the console.

<br>

-> the console is your friend, in R it even talks to you, for example if you type in something wrong.


## 2. Setting up git

I hope you all have an account already! (<span class="grayed">www.github.com</span>)

A simple `use_git()` will assist you in setting up git.

<br>

`git` (a software) is a version control system that lets you track files through their whole life.

`github` (a website) allows managing issues people might have with/find in your code.

If you do github well, it might even be a nice advertisement for your work!

<br>

-> to learn more about git, take the yDiv course by Dirk and Christian, who talk about it every other month or so.

## 3. Edit the DESCRIPTION of your package

This is an important step, because

* it lets you formulate what you even want to achieve with the package in a brief description.
* it makes metadata about your package available.

<br>

-> make sure to take care that everything is properly described here, this is the public face of your package.


## 4. Read in data & write function(s)

The backbone of your package, this is why users consult your package.

`use_data(myData)` to include data and <br>
`use_r(name = "myFunc")` to start a function. 

It is not only about *what* your package does, but also *how* it achieves that (<span class="grayed">tidyverse</span>).

<br>

-> be smart about functions. 

## 5. Document data & functions

Use roxygen commands to annotate the documentation text inside the function file.

`document()` to build the documentation.

<br>

-> even widely spread packages have a bad documentation at times. You can distinguish your package by putting effort into explaining your functions.


## 6. Build and test the package

R function run also without compiling (building).

It will often be the case that you use variables that are only available in the `Global Environment`, so you have to test a function in the package, where those variables are not available.

`build()` compiles the package, which gives you first warnings.<br>
`test()` runs the package tests.<br>
`check()` makes sure that the package is viable.

<br>

-> make use of this infrastructure, it iproves your package drastically

## Finally

7. Repeat until you are satisfied ...

8. Publish your work.





## Summary

Use RStudio to manage your package

Use git(hub/lab) to host your package for collaboration

<br>
set up package and its description
<br> -> write functions
<br> -> document functions
<br> -> build and test package
<br> -> repeat ...
<br> -> publish
